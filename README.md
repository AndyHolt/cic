# cic

cic (pronounced "sick" or "kick" as you prefer) is an experimental colouring in
creator.

The aim will be to take a picture -- whether a drawing, a poster, or a
screenshot from a TV show -- and turn it into a colouring in sheet for my son.

## Motivation

Duck Duck Go only brings up a limited number of free and good colouring in
pictures of tractors and helicopters, and my son keeps asking for new ones. I'd
also like to be able to make him colouring in sheets of his favourite characters
from TV shows he likes. These are for personal use only, with no intent to
distribute, and no desire to infringe copyright of those making creative and
educational content for kids.
